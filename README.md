# DeskStop

DeskStop is a configurable application that moves and sorts files from any directory. It can be used on any directory, but it was built with the intention of keeping my desktop clear and my downloads sorted. 

Desktop comes in three forms **Simple**, **GUI**, and **CLI**

### Simple
This version is not configurable and can be run immediately upon download with a double click. It will clean all files on your desktop into a folder in your documents named after the date the program was run. There is no whitelist, this will clean your entire desktop leaving only your recycling bin if present.

### GUI
This version of the program can be configured within a GUI to change source directory(s), target directory, and files to whitelist

### CLI
This version is the same as the GUI version but lighter weight as all configuration is done at the command line

## Installation
[GUI](https://github.com/Blake-Hill/DeskStop---Gui/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
[CLI](https://github.com/Blake-Hill/DeskStop/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
[Simple](https://github.com/Blake-Hill/DeskStop---Simple/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

## Usage
If using GUI run main.py, for the other versions run DeskStop.py

Upon launching the CLI or GUI version for the first time you will be prompted for source directory(s), target directory, and whitelist.
The source directory is the directory you want cleaned. The target directory is where you want all the files to go once sorted. Finally, the whitelist is all the files you do not want to be moved from the source directory.
